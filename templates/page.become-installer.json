The problem with traditional epoxy overlays is that the sun breaks them down, and they get hard, brittle, and fall apart. Cement based overlays have the tendency to soak up water, freeze, and delaminate. I had given up the idea of being able to do a resurface product until I found Vuba Stone. The thing that makes Vuba Stone different is that you put it on there much thicker, so it almost works like an exoskeleton over top of the concrete or whatever base you lay it on. Also, the fact that it is a urethane resin with a UV stabilizer, the sun doesn't break it down, and it has some flex to it, which allows it to hold up long-term.\nSince June of 2023, we have sold over $5,200,000 and have installed over $5,000,000.\nOur average dollar per sale is around $10k, and we specialize in the homeowner concrete repair market. Our goal for 2025 is to install $5,000,000.”"
